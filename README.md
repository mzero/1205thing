# MicroController Control Voltage Thing

The MCCV thing is a simple microcontroller board based control voltage generator for analog modular synths. Rather than specific, fixed design, this project is a collection of materials for building your own.

* 4 control voltages out, 0 ~ +8V, ~2kHz max bandwidth
* 4 trigger outs, 0 ~ 8V
* Based on a Feather M0 board
* Optional display
* Programmable in C++ or Circuit Python
* I made it for Serge, but could easily be adapted for Eurorack.
